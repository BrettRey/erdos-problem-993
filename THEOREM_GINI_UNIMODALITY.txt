SUPERSEDED — NOT A THEOREM

This file contains an empirical observation, not a proved theorem.
The "proof sketch" only shows the broom family exhibits a linear
relationship asymptotically; it does not prove the bound for all trees.
The constant C is estimated empirically (~4-5), not derived analytically.

The rigorous version of this phenomenon is the leaf-attachment
asymptotics theorem in paper/main_v2.tex (Theorem 6.2):
  nm(H_s) = 1 - C/s + O(1/s^2), C in [4, 8).

CONJECTURE (not theorem): Influence Concentration Bounds Near-Miss Ratio

================================================================================

DEFINITIONS:
-----------
For a tree T with vertex set V:

1. Influence Set: For each vertex v ∈ V, define
   S(v) = {k : there exists an independent set of size k containing v}

2. Average Influence Position: 
   a(v) = (1/|S(v)|) × Σ_{k∈S(v)} k

3. Influence Gini Coefficient:
   G(T) = Gini({a(v) : v ∈ V})
   
   where Gini({x_1,...,x_n}) = (Σ_{i<j} |x_i - x_j|) / (n × Σ_i x_i)

4. Near-Miss Ratio:
   nm(T) = max_{j ≥ d} (i_{j+1} / i_j)
   where d is the first descent and i_j are polynomial coefficients.

CONJECTURE (unproved):
---------------------
For any tree T with n vertices:

    nm(T) ≥ 1 - C × (1 - G(T))

for some constant C > 0, as n → ∞.

EQUIVALENTLY:

    1 - nm(T) ≤ C × (1 - G(T))

HEURISTIC ARGUMENT (not a proof):
---------------------------------

1. BROOM FAMILY: B(p,s) with handle length p and star size s
   
   As s → ∞:
   - G(B(p,s)) → 1 (concentrated influence)
   - nm(B(p,s)) → 1 (known from broom asymptotics)
   
   Moreover:
   - G(B(p,s)) = 1 - O(1/s)
   - nm(B(p,s)) = 1 - C_broom/s + O(1/s²)
   
   Therefore:
   nm - 1 ≈ -(C_broom/s) and G - 1 ≈ -c/s
   So: nm - 1 ≈ -(C_broom/c)(1 - G)
   
   This gives the linear relationship in the limit.

2. PATH FAMILY: P_n

   For paths:
   - G(P_n) is bounded (approximately 1/3 for large n)
   - nm(P_n) → 1 as n → ∞ but slowly
   
   This shows the bound is not tight for all families,
   but provides a lower bound.

3. STAR FAMILY: S_k

   For stars:
   - G(S_k) ≈ 1/2 for large k
   - nm(S_k) → 1 as k → ∞
   
   This shows stars achieve the limit behavior.

COROLLARIES:
------------

1. If G(T) ≥ 1 - ε, then nm(T) ≥ 1 - C×ε for small ε.

2. The broom family achieves the bound asymptotically:
   lim_{s→∞} (1 - nm(B(p,s))) / (1 - G(B(p,s))) = C_broom/c ≈ 4.12

3. Trees with maximum influence concentration (like brooms)
   are the closest to violating unimodality.

================================================================================
REMARKS:
================================================================================

1. The constant C is approximately 4-5 based on empirical fitting.

2. This provides a STRUCTURAL interpretation of near-miss behavior:
   - High influence inequality → close to unimodality violation
   - Low influence inequality → far from unimodality violation

3. The theorem does not guarantee unimodality violation for any G < 1,
   but provides a quantitative bound on how close a tree can get.

4. The proof uses the broom family as a reference case, since
   these achieve maximal influence concentration while being
   analytically tractable.
